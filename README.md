# Calories Burned Prediction Project

## Overview

The Calories Burned Project focuses on developing a machine learning-based system that accurately predicts and estimates the number of calories an individual burns during various physical activities. This repository contains the code and resources for the project.

## Project Stages

### 1. Data Collection
- Gathered data from "exercise.csv" and "calories.csv" datasets, part of the Kaggle archive, containing information about individuals' height, weight, gender, age, exercise intensity, heart rate, and body temperature.

### 2. Data Preprocessing and Analysis
- Cleaned and organized the data to make it ready for machine learning.
- Conducted in-depth analysis to understand patterns and relationships within the dataset.

### 3. Train-Test Split
- Divided the dataset into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the machine learning model effectively.

### 4. Model Creation and Training
- Developed a machine learning model to predict calorie burn based on the given features.
- Trained the model using the training dataset.

### 5. Evaluation
- Evaluated the model's performance on the testing dataset to ensure accurate predictions.

### 6. Optimization
- Fine-tuned the model parameters for optimal performance.

## Dataset Details

- Total instances: 15,000
- Attributes: 7
- Files: "exercise.csv" and "calories.csv"

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/calories-burned-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd calories-burned-project
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts for each stage.

```bash
python data_preprocessing.py
python model_training.py
# ... and so on
```

Happy coding! ðŸš€
